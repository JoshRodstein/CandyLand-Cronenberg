1. Board can have any unidirectional flow

2. Sprites vs swing icons... either sprites more complicated, modified buttons/frames/shapes easier

3. Text vs pic cards: pictures better text okay

4. Cards in deck: 5 colors 10 single 2 double = 60 total + specials
 
5. Squares to grandma's house >=40 (real life is 137)
 
6. 2,3,4 players
 
7. Going to next turn: user acknowledges their turn then clicks deck or similar
 
8. What happens on victory: message followed by quit or play again options or gloating (definitely some message tho)
 
9. User Stories per sprint: depends entirely on how much you put into a story (no shit)
  9b: Minimum of 8 for whole project as it stands now
 
10. Turn order: starting as player 1 everytime is fine, can add special ways, not necessary
  10b: follow same order everytime
 
11. Named Characters: Yes not for 1st deliverable
 
12. User config options: select token is nice 1st doesn't matter otherwise configuration is up to design group
 
13. Can we use Java canvas directly: yes, hard but allowed
 
14: Game length: 10 minutes (obviously doesnt fucking matter)
 
15: final square reached by any color that doesn't exist between you and end (grandma is every color)
 
16: Accessibility: Yes would be ideal, up to us however

17.Cards are reshuffled : fucking says so in design doc
 
18: multiple players same space
 
19: Menu System/PAusing: not needed
 
20: first to end wins (no shit)
 
21:Overarching points system: cool but nto needed for D1
 
22: kid likes candy corn
 
23: no extra design needed beyond design doc

24: Special cards can ignore movement rules
